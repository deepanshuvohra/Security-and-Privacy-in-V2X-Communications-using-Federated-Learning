# Security-and-Privacy-in-V2X-Communications-using-Federated-Learning
Advances in cellular technology are a key driver  of the growing automotive Vehicle to Everything (V2X)  market. In V2X communications, information from sensors  and other sources travels via high-bandwidth, low-latency,  high-reliability links, paving the way to fully autonomous  driving and intelligent mobility. With the future adoption  of 5G and beyond (5G&amp;B) networks, V2X is likely to  generate a huge volume of data, which encourages the use  of edge computing and pushes the system to learn the model  locally to support real-time applications. However, the edge  computing paradigm raises concerns about the security and  privacy of local nodes (e.g., vehicles) and the increased risk  of cyberattacks. In this article, we identify open research  questions, key requirements, and potential solutions to  provide cyber resilience in V2X communications.
